# GeoStatistics

GeoStatistics is a product developed in the context of my thesis: Statistical analysis of georeferenced data.
This tool aims to explore the data's geographic component based on statistical maps (such as choropleth maps), integrating data from different sources, such as:
    
    - National statistic institutes
    - Weather institutes
    - ...

There are many similar projects developed by ESRI and Microsoft to analyse geographic data, using thematic maps and charts, such as:
    - ArcGIS
    - ArcGIS WEB
    - Excel 2012

The source is divided in 3 different areas:
    
    - A Javascript API to integrate this tool on websites
    - A service layer developed on .NET & Java, to provide data for JS components
    - A web application, developed as a proof of concept
